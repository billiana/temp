But if it does not, and you had \"Launch from snapshot\" enabled, killing the emulator and restarting it WITH LAUNCH FROM SNAPHOT DISABLED, will let you of the hook. I had this problem many, many times in the last few weeks, and although adb kill-server followed by adb devices works 4 times out of 5, that fifth time the only way to get it working again is by disabling the 'launch from snapshot' option. My guess is that the emulator is somehow in a 'wrong' state, but do not understand why myself.\n",
