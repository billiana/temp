    "- Use long and descriptive names for testing functions. The style guide here is slightly different than that of running code, where short names are often preferred. The reason is testing functions are never called explicitly.  square()  or even  sqr()  is ok in running code, but in testing code you would have names such as  test_square_of_number_2() ,  test_square_negative_number() . These function names are displayed when a test fails, and should be as descriptive as possible.\n",

The implication of this rule is that each test must be loaded with a fresh dataset and may have to do some cleanup afterwards. This is usually handled by :meth:`setUp()` and :meth:`tearDown()` methods\n",
