    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- Node.js allows the creation of Web servers and networking tools using JavaScript and a collection of \"modules\" that handle various core functionality. Modules are provided for file system I/O, networking (DNS, HTTP, TCP, TLS/SSL, or UDP), binary data (buffers), cryptography functions, data streams and other core functions. Node.js's modules use an API designed to reduce the complexity of writing server applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Node.js applications can run on Linux, macOS, Microsoft Windows, NonStop, and Unix servers. They can alternatively be written with CoffeeScript (a JavaScript alternative), Dart or Microsoft TypeScript (strongly typed forms of JavaScript), or any other language that can compile to JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Node.js is primarily used to build network programs such as Web servers. The biggest difference between Node.js and PHP is that most functions in PHP block until completion (commands execute only after previous commands have completed), while functions in Node.js are designed to be non-blocking (commands execute in parallel, and use callbacks to signal completion or failure).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Platform architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "- Node.js brings event-driven programming to web servers, enabling development of fast web servers in JavaScript. Node.js connects the ease of a scripting language (JavaScript) with the power of Unix network programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Node.js was built on the Google V8 JavaScript engine since it was open-sourced under the BSD license, extremely fast, and proficient with internet fundamentals like HTTP, DNS, TCP. Also, JavaScript was a well-known language, making Node.js immediately accessible to the entire web development community.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Industry support\n",
    "\n",
    "- The open-source community has developed server frameworks to accelerate the development of applications. Such frameworks include **Connect, Express.js, Socket.IO, Koa.js, Hapi.js, Sails.js, Meteor, Derby,** and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Modern desktop IDEs provide editing and debugging features specifically for Node.js applications. Such IDEs include **Atom, Brackets, JetBrains WebStorm, Microsoft Visual Studio (with Node.js Tools for Visual Studio, or TypeScript with Node definitions), NetBeans, Nodeclipse Enide Studio (Eclipse-based) and Visual Studio Code**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Certain online web-based IDEs also support Node.js, such as Codeanywhere, Codenvy, Cloud9 IDE, Koding and the visual flow editor in Node-RED.\n",
